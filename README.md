# CIP_FS25_209
Github Repository for the project "Crystals in Switzerland"

Within this repository the following content is available which was used for the whole Project Process:

**00 Info and Structure:**
    - 00_README.md: This README file gives a short overview of how the Github Repository is set up and organized. 

**01 Scraping:**
    - 01_Initial_Scraping-Code:
    - 01_Final_Scraping-Code: 
    - 01_Initial_Dataset:

**02 API *(tried to access data of mindat.org via API as well - did not work)*:**
    - 02_Initial_Mindat-API-test:
    - 02_Second_Mindat-API-test:

**03 Preprocessing of Dataset *(was done seperately for different cleaning end enrichment topics)*:**
    - 03_Minerals_Preprocessing: 
    - 03_Minerals_Cleaned-dataset: 
    - 03_Coordinates_Preprocessing: Code for cleaning of column "Latitude & Longitude" to receive the same format for every entry and to enhance the dataset with a new column for the "Altitude". The altitude was entered with different API's. 
    - 03_Coordinates_Cleaned-dataset: Dataset based on 03_Minerals_Cleaned-dataset and cleaned with the code 03_Coordinates_Preprocessing for a new dataset. 
    - 03_Minerals-Categorization_Preprocessing:
    - 03_Minerals-Categorization_Cleaned-dataset: 
    - 03_Finalization_Preprocessing: Code for final cleaning of column names and introducing a new column for the Categorization of the Altitude. 
    - 03_Finalized_Dataset: This is the finalized dataset which was used for the Analysis. 

**04 Analysis of Dataset:**
    - 04_RQ1_Spatial-Distribution: This is the code and analysis of the first ResearchQuestion regarding the spatial Distribution. 
    - 04_RQ2_Occurence-Frequency: This is the code and analysis of the second ResearchQuestion regarding the highest frequency of occurence of the crystal types. 
    - 04_RQ3_Statistical-Correlation: This is the code and analysis of the third ResearchQuestion regarding the statistical correlation between crystal occurences and elevation levels. 

**05 Documentation:**
    - 05_CIP02_209_Feasability-Study: This is the submitted Feasability Study for the Project. 
    - 05_CIP02_209_Documentation: This is the final Project Documentation.
